# 25. Node JS

Node JS is a JavaScript *runtime* environment. Until recently, we could only use JS in a web browser. Node is the most popular implementation of JS runtime that executes code out of a browser.

This allows to have *server-side* applications that can do lots of things, using *packages*, which are libraries built by the community -*or yourself!*-, and having the ability to make applications in the same language as the *front-end* does. And, since it is supported in all operating systems, apps can be built and ported without having to re-compile for each platform.

Most common applications of Node are:
- Web servers
- Command line tools
- Native Apps (like VSCode!)
- Video Games
- *and much more!*

## Install Node
Go to the Node download page, get the installer and click to the end. Then open a terminal and enter `node`. If everything went right, it should look like this:

```sh
node
Welcome to Node.js v17.4.0.
Type ".help" for more information.

## Running JS code with Node

As seen in previous sections, JS can be run with Node in two ways: the REPL command terminal and file execution.

### The Node Read-Evaluate-Print Loop

When we type `node` in the terminal, the program that starts running is a *Node* command terminal which has a REPL.

### File execution



### `process` & `argv`
