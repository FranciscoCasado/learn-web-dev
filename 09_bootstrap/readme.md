# Bootstrap

It is a CSS *framework* that provides pre-built CSS code to make page development faster. Not everyone uses it and there are many alternatives, like Bulma, for example. It's not necessary for build a page, but it may come handy in some use cases.

One of the most *annoying* part of creating web pages is laying out the content. Bootstrap provides a grid system that may help to distribute the content using columns that take the specified amount of space, preserving some guidelines, in way that is definitely more structured than flex.
