# Section 6 - CSS

What it is: Cascading Style Sheets. Decribing *how* documents are presented visually, a.k.a. *the looks*

Everything in CSS follows this pattern
```
selector {
    property: value;
}
```

For example
This paints every `<h1>` purple
```
h1 {
    color: purple;
}
```

**CSS is huge!** - Always have the [MDN CSS Resources](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference) at hand
