# My notes of *The Web Developer Bootcamp Course*

That's what this repo is about. The course is taught by [Colt Steele](https://github.com/Colt) in the Udemy platform and is based on the 2021-2022 version.

## Files & Folders
Folders  of this repository represents a section of the course and every folder has a `readme.md` in it, containing my *personal* notes on the topics. The sections here do not match one-to-one with the online course, but no content has been skipped... *except for bootstrap* :boot:.

Apart from the `readme.md` files, some folderd contains the resultant code of the section, all coded along the lectures. They run, but may not free of bugs :bug:.

## Compiled notes
If, for some weird reason, you want to read all the notes together, I regularly compile then into the `compiled_notes.pdf` file using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), a universal document converter, with the following command:

```sh
pandoc */*.md --toc -o compiled_notes.pdf
```
