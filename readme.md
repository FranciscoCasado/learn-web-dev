# My notes of *The Web Developer Bootcamp Course*

That's what this repo is about. The course is taught by [Colt Steele](https://github.com/Colt) and is based on the 2021 version.

## Files & Folder
Every `notes*.md` contains my personal notes of one or more sections, specified by the numbers in the name of the file.

`html_excercises` is a collection of html documents written during classes that replicate what the instructor does and may have some extra *curious-sauce*.
