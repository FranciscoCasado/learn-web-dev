# The Web Developer Bootcamp 2021
*by Colt Steele*

This course has a [changelog](https://www.notion.so/Web-Developer-Bootcamp-ChangeLog-45e3eab6be724c5f9a4b83c01044e126])

The code of this course is in every lecture (and will be saved in this folder) and resources may appear if needed in every lesson

The tools needed for this course are:
- Chrome (or every othe web browser)
- VS Code (or some other text/code editing software)


Some useful resources:
- [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
- Chome Inspector


## Lesson 1: Basic Concepts
### The Internet and the Web
The internet is a **global** network of networks. It is the infrastructure that allows services such as e-mails
The World Wide eb is the system that allows sharing information over the internet. The current protocol for sharing is *Hyper Text Transfer Protocol* (HTTP) and it works with *Requests* and *Responses*. In every information exchange, we have two agents:
1. The servers are machines (computers) and also softwares that can satisfy requests on the web.
2. The client is a computer that accesses a server, i.e, the one who makes a request to ta server.

At a human level, a web browser is necessary to process the information that servers respond to our request. This processing is mostly rendering a visual representation of the information, using the instructions that the server delivers within every response.

Nowadays, the servers mostly respond with instructions that use three main technologies: HTML, JavaScript and CSS.

### Front-end and Back-eand
One suitable analogy to understand the relationshio between the front and the back ends is the kitchen and the tables in a restaurant:
1. At the table, the front-end, the waiters take your order (request)
2. Then, the kitchen, the back-end, prepares your meals (processes your request) and then delivers them with the waiters (response)

In the web development, one can separate this two ends in terms of what technologies are used to implement them: the fron-end develompent focuses on the dynamic trio HTML, JS and CSS, however the back-end may be built upon many languages: Python, C, Ruby, JS (also), Databases languages, etc.

In this course we start by understanding the front-end and then we move into the server-side :)

### Front-end: The Purple Dino Danced
The front-end technologies have unique roles as follows:

- HTML: *What*, the contents of the page (the structure)
- CSS: *How it should look*, the content display style
- JS: *Actions*, how do the page behaves and interacts

## Lesson 2: HTML
Lest's start with **HTML**
HTML is a *markup language* used to describe and annotate text format, styles and annotations. The goal of HTML is to take plain text and give it visual structure and appearances.

### HTML Elements
```
<i> italics </i>
<b> italics </b>
```

### HTML Boiler Plate
This is the *Skeleton* for every webpage:

Every page must have ONE `<head>` and ONE `<body>`. The head contains the metadata and the body is the information that will be displayed in the page.

Also, we need some tags to define this document as an HTML one by using:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        Here goes the metadada
        <title> </tile>
    </head>

    <body>
        Here goes the actual page content
    </body>
</html>
```
In VS Code you can use the *Format this document* to re-arrange the file content. The shortcut for this es `Option+Shift+F`

### Lists: ordered and unordered


```
<ul> This indicates an Unordered List opening
    <li>This is an List Item</li>
    <li>This is another List Item</li>
    <li>...</li>
    <li>...</li>
    <li>Etc :)</li>
</ul>
```
Only `<li>` can be used inside a list. But one can nest lists inside an `<li>` tag :)

### Anchor tags: provide links
anchor tags are *in-line* elements, which means the do not take their own new line. They can be accomodated inside a paragraph or any other text


## Section 3
- Undestanding what HTML5 actually is
- Block vs Inline Elements
- `span`and `div`elements
- NTH: `sub` `hr` `br`and `sup`elements   

### HTML5 is not a *version*
HTML5 is an *evolution* of the HTML Living Standard: There is no *official* version of HTML. There only a "how HTML must work": every company build their own HTML into their applications. These instructions are [here](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/). One can always use older HTML's, but it's very uncommon.



## Section 5 - HTML Forms Â¢ Tables

What we will learn: HTML tables and HTML forms (how to input data), although these days is not a good practice.
### Tables Basics:
Tables were used to *layout* content inside a webpage. We can create tables usign upto 15 elemets, but we don't actually need all of them :)

- `<table>`: declare a table block
- `<tr>`: row of a table
- `<td>`: table data (one single element)
- `<th>`: table header

These are just for proper handling of the table
- `<tbody>`: isn't
- `<thead>`: these
- `<tfoot>`: obvious?

Always follow this structure:
```
<table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th> Table Head uses table headers</th>
                <th>...</th>
                <th>...</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td> Table Body uses table data</td>
                <td>...</td>
                <td>...</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
            <tr>
                <td>...</td>
                <td>...</td>
                <td>...</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>...</td>
                <td>...</td>
                <td>...</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
```

How about multiple table headers?

### Forms
A form represents a section of the document containing interactive controls for submitting informatio

- The *action* attribute specifies WHERE the data should be sent. e.g.: `/search/`, `/tacos`
- The *method* attribute specifies which HTTP method should be used

What con go inside a form: almost any type of input and text
