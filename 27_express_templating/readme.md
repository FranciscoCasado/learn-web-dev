## Templates

Why templating? most sites use a standard *template* for displaying information, some times with slight variations, but the *layouts* are usually preserved along sites. Therefore, if we wanted to provide lots of pages, we wouldn't want to re-write over and over again the same html layout, so most web servers have *templating* tools. There are many templating engies out there, buy here we will use *Embedded JavaScript* (EJS), which is a *plain*JS, simple templating language. It is also very popular.
